# CabTripsAnalysis
The emergence of cab services provides an easy means to travel but has negatively  influenced the environment in New York City. In this project we focused on the visual  analysis of cab trips in six months along with the amount of pollution caused by the same. With the increased utilization of cab trips availed, we have seen a surge in pollution levels which made us believe that we need to build and work on an effective analysis technique to determine the increasing levels of pollution. Our data  set entices Apr-Sept figures that assisted us to work and develop a way for Traffic police and the working body in the city to keep a close eye on the surging levels. Dealing with data collected in millions, we also wanted to build an effective way so that people unfamiliar with such learnings can easily corelate the data and take the  necessary steps of action.
