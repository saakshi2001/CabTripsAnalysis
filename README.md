# CabTripsAnalysis
The emergence of cab services provides an easy means to travel but has negatively  influenced the environment in New York City. In this project we focused on the visual  analysis of cab trips in six months along with the amount of pollution caused by the same. With the increased utilization of cab trips availed, we have seen a surge in pollution levels which made us believe that we need to build and work on an effective analysis technique to determine the increasing levels of pollution. Our data  set entices Apr-Sept figures that assisted us to work and develop a way for Traffic police and the working body in the city to keep a close eye on the surging levels. Dealing with data collected in millions, we also wanted to build an effective way so that people unfamiliar with such learnings can easily corelate the data and take the  necessary steps of action.
# Functional Requirements
R programming language in particular RStudio was used which is an Integrated 
Development Environment for R, a programming language for statistical 
computing and graphics.
The following packages used are:
i. ggplot2
 This is the backbone of this project. ggplot2 is the most popular data 
visualization library that is most widely used for creating aesthetic 
visualization plots.
ii. ggthemes
 This is more of an add-on to our main ggplot2 library. With this, we can 
create better create extra themes and scales with the mainstream ggplot2 
package.
iii. lubridate
 Our dataset involves various time-frames. In order to understand our data in 
separate time categories, we will make use of the lubridate package.
iv. dplyr
 Common package between developers for Data Manipulation. 
v. DT
 With the help of this package, we will be able to interface with the JavaScript 
Library called â€“ Datatables.
vi. tidyr
 This package will help you to tidy your data. The basic principle of tidyr is to 
tidy the columns where each variable is present in a column, each 
observation is represented by a row and each value depicts a cell.
vii. scales
 With the help of graphical scales, we can automatically map the data to the 
correct scales with well-placed axes and legends.
